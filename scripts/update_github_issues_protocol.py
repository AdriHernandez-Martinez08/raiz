> **So that** I can authenticate my harvest registrations and receive payments without having to understand private keys, passwords, or 24-word seed phrases.

---

### 📜 Attestation & Security Specification
* **Session Attestation:** Upon successful OTP or QR card verification, the engine issues a temporary cryptographic `SessionAttestation` token bound to the farmer's verified phone number and community identifier.
* **Deterministic Delegation:** Links the verified session with the producer's underlying Stellar Ed25519 keypair in custody mode, enabling signed harvest attestations.
* **W3C PWA Standards:** Fully decoupled from third-party proprietary messaging APIs (WhatsApp Cloud API), eliminating per-conversation fees and suspension risks.
