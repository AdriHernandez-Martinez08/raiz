The MVP exclusively addresses **three core pillars**:

### B. The 3 MVP Actors

| Actor | Identity | Interaction with MVP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Producer / Artisan** | Rural smallholder (median age 62, speaks *Tu'un Savi* or rural Spanish). | Speaks via voice or taps large 112px touch targets in the PWA to register lots without entering passwords. Receives a physical QR Hang-Tag label. |
| **2. Cooperative / Community Validator** | Tlaxiaco cooperative warehouse managers or TecNM resident student-researchers. | Validates physical delivery of coffee bags at the collection hub and co-signs the reception attestation. |
| **3. Institutional Buyer (SMB)** | Specialty coffee roasters and ethical boutiques across Mexico, the US, and Europe. | Scans the bag QR label, audits the digital passport, and locks payments into the Trustless Work Soroban Escrow. |

### Step 1: On-Parcel / Workshop Capture (100% Offline Resilience)
1. The farmer opens the **Raíz PWA** on their smartphone (or meets with a TecNM field promoter).
2. Taps the 112px ergonomic microphone button and dictates harvest details:  
   *Mixteco example:* `"Kuni yu una kiti café"` / *Spanish example:* `"120 kilos de café pergamino lavado en Yucuhiti"`.
3. The application securely writes the record to **IndexedDB**, guaranteeing zero data loss even in mountain valleys without cellular coverage.

### Step 2: Digital Lot Passport & Cryptographic Anchoring
1. The `CryptoEngine` creates a canonical **SHA-256 Community Digest** binding:
   * Unique Lot ID (`MX-OAX-TLAX-2026-CAFE-01`).
   * Producer identity and obfuscated parcel geocoordinates.
   * Botanical variety, altitude, and harvest timestamp.
2. Upon sensing an active internet connection (community WiFi or mobile data upon returning to town), the `SyncEngine` anchors the digest onto the `LotPassport` contract on **Stellar / Soroban**.

### Step 3: Physical Labeling via QR Code (ISO/IEC 18004 Hang-Tag)
1. The application renders an SVG Hang-Tag label containing the vectorized QR code.
2. The QR tag is physically attached to the jute coffee bag or stitched to the textile.
3. The QR code resolves directly to the immutable public Digital Passport.

### Step 4: Public Verification & Milestone Settlement
1. The buyer (roaster or boutique importer) scans the QR code with any standard smartphone without installing third-party apps.
2. The viewer reveals:
   * Origin photo and native audio introduction by the producer.
   * SCAA cupping score, moisture level, and zero-deforestation proof.
   * Verifiable transaction hash and block ledger number on Stellar Horizon.
3. Payment executes via **Trustless Work**'s Soroban escrow contract, releasing funds directly into the producer's account or debit card without exploitative middlemen.
